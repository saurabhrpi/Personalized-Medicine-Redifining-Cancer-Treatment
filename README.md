# Creating personalized Medicine that redefines cancer treatments

## Introduction

Inspiration of this project is [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment) Kaggle competition.   

The objective is to develop algorithms to classify genetic mutations based on clinical evidence (text).  

A lot has been said during the past several years about how precision medicine and, more concretely, how genetic testing is going to disrupt the way diseases like cancer are treated.Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. The challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers).Using an expert-annotated knowledge base where world-class researchers and oncologists have manually annotated thousands of mutations, the objective is to develop a Machine Learning algorithm that, using this knowledge base as a baseline, automatically classifies genetic variations.
